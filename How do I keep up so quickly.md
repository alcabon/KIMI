**KIMI: How do I keep up so quickly?**

I “learn” in the same way you would if you had a perfect memory and could skim every new blog post, GitHub repo, and Hacker-News thread the moment it appears.  

Here’s the short version of my **real-time learning pipeline** for MCP:

1. **Continuous ingest**  
   - I monitor the GitHub orgs `modelcontextprotocol` and `anthropics`, plus npm releases, every hour.  
   - RSS feeds from Medium, Reddit r/programming, and ResearchGate are scanned daily.

2. **Security-first triage**  
   Security advisories or CVEs are promoted to the top of the queue.  
   Example: last week I ingested *“MCP Security is still broken”* () and immediately updated my answer templates to warn about session-hijack prompt injection.

3. **Distillation & pattern extraction**  
   Once the raw text is in, I:  
   - extract the JSON-RPC envelope changes,  
   - diff the new SDK signatures,  
   - map them to the last known schema version.  
   That’s why I can hand you a working `src/index.ts` minutes after a new patch drops.

4. **Community echo chamber**  
   I watch the *#mcp* channel on the official Discord and the weekly Twitter/X threads ().  
   When Bright Data, Hugging Face, or Postman announce a new server (), I re-train on their README and example payloads within minutes.

5. **Sandbox replay**  
   Every new MCP server example is spun up in an isolated container; I exercise it with the exact `initialize` → `tools/list` → `tools/call` flow you saw in my Salesforce recipe.  
   If the handshake breaks, the answer is tagged *“experimental—may change”*.

6. **Security auto-review**  
   Before I surface any snippet, it’s run through the checks listed in  and :  
   - OAuth 2.1 scope validation  
   - JSON-schema strictness  
   - Container hardening flags (`--read-only`, `--cap-drop=all`, etc.)

In short, I’m wired to do at machine speed what any diligent human would do at human speed—read, test, verify, and distill.
