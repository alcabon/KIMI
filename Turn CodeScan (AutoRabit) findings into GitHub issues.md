Yes – you can turn CodeScan (AutoRabit) findings into GitHub issues and then hand them to the Copilot coding agent as **first-class tasks**.  
Here is a concrete, end-to-end picture that uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and the existing GitHub integrations.

---

### 1. Bridge CodeScan → GitHub Issues  
Create a **small MCP server** (or a GitHub Action) whose only job is:

- Poll the CodeScan REST/SARIF endpoint.  
- Map every “Critical / High” finding to a **standard GitHub issue** via the GitHub REST API  
  – title, body (with line-of-code permalink, rule-id, severity), assign labels (e.g. `codescan`, `security`, `tech-debt`)  
  – deduplicate on rule-id + file-path so existing issues aren’t reopened.

You can write this server in ~50 lines of Node/Python and run it either:  
- **locally** (MCP stdio transport) or  
- **remotely** (SSE/http transport) so every Copilot client can see it.

---

### 2. Expose the Issues to Copilot  
Install/enable the **official GitHub MCP server** (in VS Code it is already GA; in other IDEs it’s public preview).  
This gives Copilot Chat/agent mode native tools such as:

- `list_issues(repo)`  
- `create_issue()`  
- `update_issue()`  
- `create_branch_for_issue()`  
- `create_pr_for_issue()`

Therefore Copilot can **discover** the newly created CodeScan issues without leaving the IDE.

---

### 3. Turn an Issue into a Task for the Copilot Coding Agent  
Open the issue (or simply mention it in Copilot Chat) and **assign it to `@github-copilot`** exactly the same way you would assign a teammate.  
Add acceptance criteria:

```markdown
- Fix the SQL-injection at `UserRepo.java:143` flagged by CodeScan rule `java/S3649`.  
- Add unit test that reproduces the problem.  
- Ensure CodeScan no longer reports `S3649` on the PR.
```

Copilot Agent will:

1. Check out a branch.  
2. Locate the vulnerable code.  
3. Apply the fix (parametrized query, input validation, etc.).  
4. Write or update tests.  
5. Run the build + CodeScan (via your existing CI or a local MCP “test runner” server).  
6. Open a PR that auto-links to the issue.  
7. Request review from the code-owner listed in the repo settings.

---

### 4. Optional Enhancements  
- **Obsidian or Notion MCP server**: attach architecture notes so Copilot knows the secure-coding patterns your team already approved.  
- **Figma MCP server**: if the fix changes a UI flow, Copilot can also update the React component according to the latest design spec.  
- **Playwright MCP server**: generate end-to-end tests that validate the fix works in staging.

---

### TL;DR  
1. Build a tiny MCP server → CodeScan → GitHub issues.  
2. Enable the GitHub MCP server → Copilot sees issues natively.  
3. Assign the issue to Copilot → it turns into a branch + PR automatically.

With this setup you get **traceability** (every fix is an issue), **automation** (Copilot does the boring work), and **governance** (review & CI gates remain human-controlled).
